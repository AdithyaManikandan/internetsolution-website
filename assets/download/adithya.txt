Wellcome my World!
hey This is Adithyamanikandan Jawaher
Passionate about data science, geospatial analysis, and web development, I am currently pursuing my masterâ€™s degree at Maynooth University, Ireland. During my undergraduate studies in Computer Science Engineering at Meenakshi Sundararajan Engineering College, I gained hands-on experience through internships in Chennai, where I explored various aspects of business and technology.

I have also worked on freelance web application development projects for gyms and retail stores, helping businesses enhance their digital presence. In addition to my academic and professional journey, I am actively involved in fencing and data science communities, always eager to connect with like-minded individuals worldwide.
